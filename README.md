# Tasks Kata

A client needs your help  to solve a problem about the way he is organizing stuffs he needs to be done. He would like you to develop an API that he can use in its own to handle all activities he does in everyday basis.  

Use Buffalo framework to create an API that handles Task items.


A task represents an activity or an actionable item for a group of things that needs to be done or completed. Every task has a description explaining what need to be done, a status (whether if it was done/completed or not), a completion date, the name of the person who requested the task and the name of the person who executed it.

### USER STORIES
1- As an API user I would like to see all tasks that are currently stored in tasks storage.   
2- As an API user I would like to be able to create tasks and add it to the tasks storage.  
3- As an API user I would like to request all tasks that needs to be done.  
4- As an API user I would like to request all tasks that are done.  
5- As an API user I would like to request all tasks done in a specific time range.  
6- As an API user I would like to request all tasks done by a specific person.  
7- As an API user I would like to request all tasks requested by a specific person.  


### NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
API should only speak JSON language.
Follow TDD approach to solve the problem.
Enjoy and have fun.


**GOAL**: Start to get deeper with TDD by applying it when you're developing Buffalo Apps.
